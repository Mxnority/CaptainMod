# CaptainMod

Pandapip1's captain mod adds a new role, the captain, that can call a meeting from anywhere and can zoom out. Idea borrowed from Bakpak and Launchpad. If you want to play this mod, don't want bugs, and want more features, use Launchpad instead: http://discord.gg/allofus. This is more a reference for other modders.

### Using the Source code or the mod

Please credit me (Pandapip1#8943) somewhere noticeable (E.G. A video's description or the top pinned comment if you are using the mod in a video, or next to the download link if you are distributing a modified mod)
